# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher Algorithm

A simple GUI-based Caesar Cipher tool built using Python and Tkinter. This application allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting characters using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.

What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest ciphers used for encryption. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This tool applies the same logic to all characters, including non-alphabetic ones, using their ASCII values.

Features
1. Encrypt or decrypt text by providing a shift value.
2. Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter.
3. Instant results shown in the same window.
4. Basic input validation for shift values and task selection.

üìù Usage Instructions
Select Task: Enter E to Encrypt or D to Decrypt.

Enter Shift Value: Input the numeric value by which characters should be shifted.

Enter Text: The text you want to encrypt or decrypt.

Click Execute to see the result.

üì¶ Requirements
Python 3.x
(Tkinter is included by default in most Python installations)
